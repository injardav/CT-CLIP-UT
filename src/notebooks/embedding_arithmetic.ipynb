In addition, there are soft tissue densities in the middle lobe of the right lung, the anterior segment of the upper lobe, and the posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the lung, which are evaluated in favor of stable primarily fibroatelectasis changes according to the previous examination. Liver and spleen sizes increased in the upper abdominal sections included in the study area. In the current intra-abdominal examination, there is newly emerging free fluid. Between the bilateral pleural leaves, there is an effusion measuring 1 cm in thickness on the left and 5 mm on the right. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures. In the left hilus localization, adjacent to the left main pulmonary artery, there is a mass lesion with spiculated contours whose borders cannot be clearly defined since the examination is uncontrasted, and a newly emerged large bronchopneumonic infiltration area in the current examination in the distal of the mass. Apart from this, in the current examination in both lungs, there is a newly emerging ground-glass density increase around it. There are areas of nodular consolidation. The appearance suggests fungal pneumonia. Clinical-laboratory correlation and post-treatment control are recommended.  Hepatosplenomegaly.
